Overview
In this section, we will set up the Ansible lab environment that we’ll use throughout the course. The lab uses Docker, so we’ll begin with installing Docker Desktop.

We will cover:

Installation of Docker Desktop on Mac OS and Windows

Installation of Docker on Linux (using Ubuntu as a reference)

Setting up our lab environment using Docker Compose

Configuring passwordless SSH connectivity for Ansible

Setting up the course code repository and validating our environment
