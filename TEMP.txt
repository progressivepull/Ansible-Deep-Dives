Overview
In this section, we will set up the Ansible lab environment that we’ll use throughout the course. The lab uses Docker, so we’ll begin with installing Docker Desktop.

We will cover:

Installation of Docker Desktop on Mac OS and Windows

Installation of Docker on Linux (using Ubuntu as a reference)

Setting up our lab environment using Docker Compose

Configuring passwordless SSH connectivity for Ansible

Setting up the course code repository and validating our environment

************************************************

**2. Understand Ansible connectivity**

* Ansible is agentless, meaning it doesn’t require an agent on the target hosts.

* It does require connectivity from the Ansible control host to the inventory targets, typically via SSH on Linux systems.

**3. Configure passwordless SSH connectivity**
* We will set up SSH keys so that our Ansible control host can connect to the target hosts without requiring passwords each time.

**4. Set up the course code repository**
* Finally, we will clone and validate the course repository to ensure our environment is ready for the hands-on labs.
