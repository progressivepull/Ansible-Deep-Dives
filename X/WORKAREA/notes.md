Linux root users us $
Ah, I see where the confusion might be. In Linux, the command prompt symbol gives you a quick visual cue about the user's privilege level:

$ â€” This symbol indicates you're logged in as a regular (non-root) user.

# â€” This symbol means you're operating as the root user (or using elevated privileges via sudo or su).

So if your terminal shows a $, you're in safe, non-destructive territory. If it shows #, tread carefullyâ€”youâ€™ve got superpowers, and with great power comes... well, you know the rest.

Want to explore how to safely switch between users or set up sudo access for specific tasks?

create regular (non-root) user

ðŸ§° Basic Command
bash
sudo adduser johndoe
This creates a new user named johndoe.

It automatically prompts for password and user details.

The sudo prefix ensures the command is run with root privileges.

ðŸ“‚ Home Directory & Shell
By default, adduser:

Creates a home directory at /home/johndoe

Assigns the default shell, usually /bin/bash
