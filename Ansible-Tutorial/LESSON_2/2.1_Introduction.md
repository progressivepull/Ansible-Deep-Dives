# 2.1 Introduction

Ansible ad-hoc commands provide a fast and powerful way to execute single tasks across one or many managed nodes without creating a full playbook. They are designed for simplicity, speed, and immediate results, making them ideal for system administration, troubleshooting, validation, and learning how Ansible works.

Unlike playbooks, which are written in YAML and intended for repeatable, structured automation, ad-hoc commands are executed directly from the command line using Ansible modules. This allows you to quickly perform actions such as checking connectivity, running remote commands, managing packages and services, and gathering system information.

# What Are Ad-Hoc Commands?

Ad-hoc commands are used for **quick, repeatable actions** such as:

* Checking connectivity
* Running shell commands remotely
* Managing packages and services
* Gathering system information

They are ideal for **exploration, diagnostics, and simple automation**, but not for complex workflows (use playbooks for that).

# Basic Syntax

```
ansible <host-pattern> -m <module> -a "<module arguments>"
```

## Components

* **host-pattern** – Target hosts or groups from inventory
* **-m**– Ansible module to use
* **-a** – Arguments passed to the module

# Inventory File

The **Ansible inventory** defines the hosts and groups of hosts that Ansible manages. It tells Ansible where to run ad-hoc commands and playbooks. Without an inventory, Ansible has no knowledge of target systems.

An inventory can be **static** (a simple file) or **dynamic** (generated from cloud providers, CMDBs, or scripts). For learning and most on‑premise use cases, a static inventory file is sufficient.

Example inventory.ini:

```
[web]
web1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10
web2 ansible_host=192.168.1.11


[db]
db1 ansible_host=192.168.1.20
```

In this example:

* **web** and **db** are host groups
* **web1**, **web2**, and **db1** are logical host names
* ansible_host specifies the actual IP address or DNS name
